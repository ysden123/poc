= queues

POC project. Playing with queue.

== Queue1
Queue1 class is example of queue with standard Scala collection. No synchronization was used.

== Queue2
Queue2 class is example of queue with standard Scala collection. __syncrhonized__ is used for queue synchronization.

== ConcurrentLinkedQueue1
ConcurrentLinkedQueue1 class is example of queue with Java concurrent collection. Synchronization out of the box.

== SynchronousQueue1
SynchronousQueue1 class is example of queue with Java concurrent collection. Synchronization out of the box.

Among all Java concurrent collections, SynchronousQueue is different.
**Capacity of a synchrounous queue is always _zero_**. It is because in SynchronousQueue an insert will wait for a remove operation by another thread and vice versa.
