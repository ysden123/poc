# logging

How to use logging inside library jar.

Source code in main code uses a logging - SLF4J (via scala logging).

The _main_ resources doesn't contain definition of the log properties.

The _test_ resources contains definition of the log properties.

_build.sbt_ specifies logback-classic for _test_ execution only.

A project that will use the JAR have to define implementation of the log framework - include dependency for log implementation..
